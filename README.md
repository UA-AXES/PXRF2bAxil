## Using PAXRF2bAxil

On the app, click on `File` to load Innov-X CSV files containing one of more spectra. You can view the spectra selecting them on the right table. The displayed one can be saved as a bAxil AXML file. Alternatively you can also save the spectrum as an SPE file or as a TXT file. The best file type is AXML because it is the native format that bAxil can open directly. The SPE and TXT files can be imported by bAxil.
